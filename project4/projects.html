                    <p id="magazine-info">
                        The digital magazine is a project for the Advanced Electronic Publishing class I took at UMGC. Displayed is the cover of a Bloomsberg Businessweek magazine that I recreated using Adobe InDesign. This was an exciting project to work on because it was geared more toward focusing on user interaction and animations using the software. The challenge I faced in this project was applying animations and making them make sense. I ended up focusing on the artistic pieces on the page and placing animations there, like: sliding images in from the side onto article pages and animating border details of pages.

                    <p id="coloring-info">
                        This was one of my most exciting projects in Illustrator. I created it in February of 2022. The assignment was to create a coloring book page for my Illustrator class at UMGC. I was required to provide a blank page and a colored page. The character drawn is Louise Belcher from Bob Burger's. She is the fiery character out of all the characters in the show. The scene drawn was inspired by an episode when she went into a raging fit seeking revenge on the neighborhood bully. In that scene, the background actually turns to fire as she laughs hysterically.

                    <p id="poster-info">
                        The requirement for the poster project was to create a poster for a national park to attract more visitors. I find Saguaro Park through a Google search and found this image of a cactus taken in the dark. From the angle it was taken, the light practically reflected off the cactus - it was really beautiful. I used that image as inspiration for this project. To demonstrate lighter spots in the sky and the light bouncing off the cactus, I needed to use lighter colors to give that effect. This was done in March 2022.

                    <h3>Movie Poster</h3>
                    <p id="movie-info">
                        In a Photoshop class taken at UMGC, we had to create our own sci-fi movie poster. I wanted to go with superheroes as I am a huge Marvel fan, so I chose to use Thor. Thor movies have a lot of theatrics and sci-fi effects that I thought this project could use, especially needing to incorporate some effects in the poster. I cropped out the Thor character from a war scene in one of his movies and placed it on top of two backgrounds that I blended together for a grander effect as the lightning bolt strikes in the image.
