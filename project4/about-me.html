                    <p>I am quite an ambitious engineer when it comes to programming and my path was not as straightforward from the beginning. I started out as a music technology major my freshman year of college, then I got into radio after hosting my first show on campus. I started out my web development career three years ago while interning in DC with a marketing team and taking side gigs to build clients' sites on WordPress and Shopify. I began studying at the University of Maryland Global Campus for my bachelor's in Digital Media & Web Technology, shortly after realizing I can really build a career in web development.</p>
                    <p>I currently work as a UI Engineer at a cybersecurity company and I enjoy the work. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack engineer working in both the front-end and back-end development of websites and apps. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as their respective frameworks. I am experienced in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign software.</p>
